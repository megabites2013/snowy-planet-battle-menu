The Snowy Planet Battle Menu
============================

(More detailed walkthrough on it's way)
---------------------------------------

A fun little example menu for iOS 7+ and OS X 10.9+ using SpriteKit. Using that framework and relatively few lines of code, you can get some cool interactivity going on in your menus or other views.

There is a title floating around with some orbiting lasers, that then shoot at whatever button you press. The scene changes to a new screen, demonstrating how you can make a transition to a screen of your choice. In this example, just tap anywhere on the screen to return to the menu.

Feel free to explore the code and use whatever parts might help you! Also, be sure to look for the "redirect" easter egg :)
